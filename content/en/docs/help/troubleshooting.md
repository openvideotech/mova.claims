## WebSocket not enabled

This means there is no connection to Holochain.

## Random Javascript error in a popup box

Mostly these are harmless notices from [Holochain](/docs/concept/holochain/), saying something like "A Javascript error occurred in the main process, and then a long string", and can be cleared by clicking ok.

## Bigger trouble…

Say hello at mova @ openvideo.tech.

## Even bigger trouble…

Post an issue on the [Gitlab](https://lab.openvideo.tech/mova).
