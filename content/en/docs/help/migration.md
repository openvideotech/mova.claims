1. Download mova to your new computer, make sure it is the same version ([updating](/docs/help/how-to-update) on your old machine first if needed)
2. Locate your user folder on your old computer. In the profile page of mova there is a link to help you find this.
3. Copy the entire folder to the same location on your new computer, replacing whatever is there.
