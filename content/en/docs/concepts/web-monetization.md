[Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org) is a new decentralised subscription protocol connecting a user’s subscription wallet, embedded in their browser through a plugin, and websites with an ILP address in their header tags. 

It’s currently implemented by [Coil](https://coil.com), which pays out typically $0.36/hour while a user is on a monetization-enabled website. This compares very well against payouts from Spotify or YouTube.

Web Monetization allows for a decoupling of single end-to-end subscription services, allowing for a new human-curated ecosystem for media-discovery. However by using a payment pointer in a web page’s header to to identify payee, it flattens the layers of content owner, content sharer or curator, and host.
